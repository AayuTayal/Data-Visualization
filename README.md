# Data-Visualization

The primary objective of this project was to develop an intuitive and interactive web-based application to monitor and visualize real time chemical plant data(which can be process measurements and
manipulated variables) for real time fault detection in industrial process control systems.
Traditional approaches often fall short due to their reliance on predefined thresholds or expert knowledge, which may not generalize well across diverse environments. With the in- creasing complexity of
dynamic systems, there is a pressing need for automated and robust fault detection mechanisms capable
of processing large volumes of data and detecting anomalies with high accuracy.
The challenge was to create a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly interface that could handle
continuous data streams from sensors, apply advanced machine learning techniques for fault classification,
and present results in an accessible graphical format for engineers and analysts.
The problem originated from the need for automated fault detection in Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) data, a standard dataset used for benchmarking fault diagnosis algorithms in industrial
settings. Traditional approaches required manual inspection of sensor logs, leading to delayed responses,
inefficiencies, and increased operational costs. Our solution aimed to automate this process, providing
instant fault detection and comprehensive summary reports.
